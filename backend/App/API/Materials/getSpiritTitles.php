/**
 * Retrieve and output tract titles by language as a JSON response.
 *
 * This script handles the retrieval of tract titles based on the language name. It utilizes
 * various services and models to fetch the required data from the database. The results
 * are returned as a JSON-encoded response, making it easy for front-end applications to
 * consume and display the available tracts by language.
 *
 * The script works with the following components:
 * - **SpiritController**: Handles the logic for retrieving tract titles by interacting with the model and resource services.
 * - **SpiritModel**: Interfaces with the database to query for tract-related data.
 * - **DatabaseService**: Manages the database connection and handles queries.
 * - **ResourceService**: Provides additional functionality related to resource management, if needed.
 *
 * The method `getTitlesByLanguageName()` is called to fetch the titles of the tracts available in the specified language.
 *
 * @return void Outputs a JSON response containing the tract titles.
